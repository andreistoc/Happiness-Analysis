## Task Details

The attached data-set shows the happiest countries on earth. You may join any data you want to explain why countries are ranked as they are here.

The goal of this task is to find out what factors contribute to happiness. You can join any other data and use any insights you might have that show a strong correlation between the factors you come up with.  

Expected Submission We want the final code to be submitted on Github and a demo of it in the final interview.  

Please use comments to explicit the code.  The solution should contain the correlation between the factors discovered and the happiness score of the data-set (the actual number).  Any charts explaining this correlation will also help.  Evaluation The best solutions will both have a good correlation score, but are also creative and explain the work well.

### Solution is in Happiness Analysis.ipynb

Normally .ipynb files are rendered by Github directly in the browser, but I saw that it can fail sometimes, So I attached a .pdf as well.
