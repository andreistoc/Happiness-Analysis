    "The attached data-set shows the happiest countries on earth. You may join any data you want to explain why countries are ranked as they are here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to find out what factors contribute to happiness. You can join any other data and use any insights you might have that show a strong correlation between the factors you come up with.  \n",

    "Expected Submission We want the final code to be submitted on Github and a demo of it in the final interview.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please use comments to explicit the code.  The solution should contain the correlation between the factors discovered and the happiness score of the data-set (the actual number).  Any charts explaining this correlation will also help.  Evaluation The best solutions will both have a good correlation score, but are also creative and explain the work well.\n"

    "### What is Dystopia?\n",
    "Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world’s least-happy people. The purpose in establishing Dystopia is to have a benchmark against which all countries can be favorably compared (no country performs more poorly than Dystopia) in terms of each of the six key variables, thus allowing each sub-bar to be of positive (or zero, in six instances) width. The lowest scores observed for the six key variables, therefore, characterize Dystopia. Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world’s lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom, and least social support, it is referred to as “Dystopia,” in contrast to Utopia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the residuals?\n",
    "The residuals, or unexplained components, differ for each country, reflecting the extent to which the six variables either over- or under-explain average 2017-2019 life evaluations. These residuals have an average value of approximately zero over the whole set of countries. Figure 2.1 shows the average residual for each country if the equation in Table 2.1 is applied to average 2017- 2019 data for the six variables in that country. We combine these residuals with the estimate for life evaluations in Dystopia so that the combined bar will always have positive values. As can be seen in Figure 2.1, although some life evaluation residuals are quite large, occasionally exceeding one point on the scale from 0 to 10, they are always much smaller than the calculated value in Dystopia, where the average life is rated at 1.97 on the 0 to 10 scale. Table 7 of the online Statistical Appendix 1 for Chapter 2 puts the Dystopia plus residual block at the left side, and also draws the Dystopia line, making it easy to compare the signs and sizes of the residuals in different countries.\n",
